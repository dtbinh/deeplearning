\section{Methods}
Reinforcement learning problems are often solved within a discrete action space. But to control a robotic arm continues actions are required. 


%The main method for reinforcement learning for the control of the arm will be the CACLA algorithm. The main method for the perception part will be CNN. 
%The reason to use CALCA is because to control the arm continues actions are needed, instead of distrete actions.
