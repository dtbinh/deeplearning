\section{Theoretical framework}
Reinforcement learning is an area in machine learning in which an agent needs to take actions in an environment which provides the highest reward for that agent. The environment of a reinforcement learning problem
is described as a Markov desicion process (MDP) \cite{markov}. A MDP consists out of States, Actions, and Rewards ** NEEDS BETTER EXPLANATION ****. The goal is to find a policy that will provide the best action based on the current state. 
For this purpose we will use the CACLA algorithm. CACLA is created to handle the continues action space, which is needed to control a robotic arm. An action in this case is the velocity of a single actuator (joint) of the 
robotic arm, which can move with different speeds.
