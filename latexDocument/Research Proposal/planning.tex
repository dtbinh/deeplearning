\section{Planning}

\textbf{September}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize research proposal
  \item Extended literate research (Batch normalization, drop-out, soft-target updates)
  \item Setup for real world testing (Arm and Camera positions)
  \item Setup computers for running experiments and scripts to run remotely
  \item Framework for control network, including different architecture setups (without optimizations like batch normalization, etc)
  \item Framework for testing the control network, in both simulation and on the real arm (Mico arm only)
  \item Start with experiments for control network (Learn to go to position)
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{October}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Extend Framework with optimizations (Batch normalization, drop-out, etc)
 \item Experiments with optimizations (Learn to go to position)
 \item 
\end{itemize}


%- Setup real experimental setup (camera position) *
%- Control network
% - Go to a single position
% - Grasp object using manual input
% - Different architectures
% - Different Arms
% - Writing

%- Perception
%  - Learn 3D localization for simple objects
%  - Train in simulation, works in real world? 
%  - Train real world dataset
%  - Writing
  
%- Total network
%  - Combine Perception and Control network
%  - Test in simulation, possible on different arms (First use best arm to train for found in Control network part)
%  - Test in real-world, Mico arm. 
%  - Fine-tuning step from simulation to real world?
%  - Possible training, using object locater (pointcloud based approach for object clustering and location, BORG stuff)
%  - Writing
  
% - Finish Thesis
