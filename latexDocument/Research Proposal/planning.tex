\section{Planning}

\textbf{November}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize research proposal
  \item Extended literate research (Batch normalization, drop-out, soft-target updates)
  \item Setup for real world testing (Arm and Camera positions), and simulation setup.
  \item Setup computers for running experiments and scripts to run remotely  
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{December}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Framework for control network, including different architecture setups (without optimizations like batch normalization, etc)
  \item Framework for testing the control network, in both simulation and on the real arm (Mico arm only)
  \item Get MoveIt to work with Mico arm in simulation and on the real arm. 
  \item Thesis writing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{January}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start with experiments for control network (Learn to go to position)
  \item Extend Framework with optimizations (Batch normalization, drop-out, etc)
  \item Experiments with optimizations (Learn to go to position), different architectures, different arms, grasping
  \item Thesis writing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{February}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize control network fine-tuning, should have a working network for grasping objects based on manual input.
  \item Experiments comparing inverse kinematic controller versus control network.
  \item Thesis writing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{March}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend framework to work with CNN for perception part
  \item Experiments with getting 3D position of objects, test if simulation training works in real world
  \item Create large dataset of objects (script for creating objects in simulation, or create real world dataset)
  \item Experiments with RGB, RGBD, and Pointcloud as input
  \item Experiments with how to grasp objects
  \item Thesis writing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{April}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Combine Perception network with Control network
  \item Experiment with different architectures, different arms
  \item Finalize experiments with complete working system so that real arm can grasp objects
  \item Experiments comparing inverse kinematic controller versus complete network
  \item Thesis writing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{May}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize experiments with different arms grasping objects in simulation 
  \item Extra time for experiments in case needed
  \item Start writing final version Thesis
\end{itemize}
\textbf{June}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize Thesis
\end{itemize}
