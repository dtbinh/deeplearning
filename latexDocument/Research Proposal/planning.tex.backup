\section{Planning}

\textbf{September}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalize research proposal
  \item Extended literate research (Batch normalization, drop-out, soft-target updates)
  \item Setup for real world testing
\end{itemize} 
- Setup real experimental setup (camera position)
- Control network
 - Go to a single position
 - Grasp object using manual input
 - Different architectures
 - Different Arms
 - Writing

- Perception
  - Learn 3D localization for simple objects
  - Train in simulation, works in real world? 
  - Train real world dataset
  - Writing
  
- Total network
  - Combine Perception and Control network
  - Test in simulation, possible on different arms (First use best arm to train for found in Control network part)
  - Test in real-world, Mico arm. 
  - Fine-tuning step from simulation to real world?
  - Possible training, using object locater (pointcloud based approach for object clustering and location, BORG stuff)
  - Writing
  
- Finish Thesis
