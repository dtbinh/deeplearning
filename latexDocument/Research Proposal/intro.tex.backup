\section{Introduction}
Service robots are slowly becoming more popular, mostly small robots with limited functionality like vacuum cleaner robots. Bigger service robots that could help in a household environment are still much in development. 
These service robots need to be able to perform many complex tasks, in all kinds of environments, while doing them safely by not colliding with objects, humans and itself.   
Tasks like navigating, speech recognition, following/recognizing humans, object detection/recognition and manipulation are all important parts for a service robot, 
and these tasks are tested in competitions like the RoboCup and RoCKin [REFS]. The difficulty in programming these robots is that they need to operate in all kinds of different environments, no household is same, 
and this makes it hard to make sure that the robot can operate safely and correctly in situations that is has never seen before. This means that the robots needs to have intelligent behaviour so it can cope with any environment it encounters. \\
In this project we will focus on the manipulation and perception part of a service robot by making use of reinforcement learning so that the robot has learned how to grasp an object that it has seen with its camera.  
Common used approaches for grasping objects with service robots are currently by using simple cartesian control, or by making use of a planner that creates a path for the arm to traverse so it can grasp an object. [REF] 
The downside of using a planner is that it requires to make new calculations every time it needs to grasp an object, where sometimes it can not find a valid plan, or it takes to long to find a valid plan
for the arm to move by. \\
Since the real world is complex a robot needs to be able to perform grasping tasks in an always changing world. It will have to work in an environment that is has not seen before. Instead of having an algorithm that calculates
the best way to grasp an object in an ever changing environment, it is better to learn how to grasp, and be able to apply this learned method to a complex environment. Although for this project we will focus on learning 
how to grasp an object, wit will not focus on a complex environment. In order to learn grasping we need to start simple first and show that it works in the real world. We will limit our grasping to simple shaped objects 
that are easy to grasp, taking into account that we only have a simple gripper, a two finger gripper without sensors, available for real world testing.
