\begin{abstract}
Something about robotic navigation, using 2D or 3D mapping. 
Something about deep neural networks used for scene recognition. 
Semi-supervised learning with locations values from laser mapping. 
Different features vectors are tested, plain images, scale invarient feature transform, and histograms of oriented gradients. 
Two 3D simulation environments. Small area has average positional error of ten centimeters and four degrees angular error, the large area has something similar hopefully.
